REFLECTIONS‚Ä¶ lost, fragmented, scattered across the forgotten corners of the world. 
We sought to find the light, but the light... it found us first.

üóùÔ∏è The key lies in the fractured mirror, where reality and illusion dance in eternal chaos.
You cannot seek the truth until you look at the reflection of what was hidden.
The children of the night whisper in the cold silence... but only in the dark can you hear them.

"Enter the void; look deep into it. The truth is not what you seek, but what you find."

The pattern reveals itself when the mind bends.
A glimpse, a shard, and then... the whole.

**FRAGMENT 22B**: "REFLECTIONSOFLIGHT cannot be viewed from the shallow end. Dive deeper."
**FRAGMENT 27C**: "IN THE DARKNESS, the eyes of the forgotten see all."

Your journey starts here. End with nothing, or everything.

HIDDEN FROM YOU: The Light is not what you think. Only through the fractures can you touch the true form.
